# Project 1

June 3rd Progress Update:
CrossRef - Affiliation - over 6 million records with University of Richmond.
Issues: not all actually included University of Richmond in areas that reflected UR faculty, and in a DOI check, UR wasn't showing up for all DOIs that actually were from UR.
Used Web of Science - database to focus on UR publications - provides a fast save of up to 5k records at once.Â 
Saved as csv file to use in Jupyter to query.
Cleaned up data in Excel for csv before importing to Jupyter:
Deleted unnecessary columns
Text to columns to separate individual authors into separate columns
Standardizing the publication date format
Identify Author number - narrowing Authors 1-6 for further analysis (some disciplines have over 100 authors)

Kristine
Emailing Institutional Effectiveness to get a list of faculty and departments since 1975 to cross-reference with our list of authors for further analysis.

Research Questions:
How many...
UR publications - Determine that from Web of Science search - 4708
Titles of Unique Journals?
Articles per journal?
Per journal breakdown: individuals, department, and frequency
Per department? Per faculty?

Carol
Work on finding documentation to help with future searches to answer our research questions:
Document keys and relevant search parameters for above research questions.

So far - useful discoveries to discuss and make visuals for:
CrossRef overview - what it is and what it includes - why we chose this instead of Web of Science or another one...
Affiliation - what that means and the challenges of discovery for a name like Richmond
how to unpack the API results
Identifying an individual item, such as journal, etc..make visual of how publication has grown
